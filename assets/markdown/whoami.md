Hello world. I am `Skelly`, some may also know me as Copernicus. 
I am a student who is fascinated with the world of IT, especially cyber security.
My parents got me my first computer in the `age of 3`. It was a chunky `Macintosh desktop`
\*probably the best gift I got from them, besides me (of course)\*.
Some years later (after I smh broke that piece of Apple art) I got an HP desktop rolling Windows 7, which I still use to this very day. <br>
I started playing with the good old `batch` and `VBS scripts` on windows, making simple prankware and messing around with my schools computers. <br>
Then I found out \*by mistake\* about high-level programming languages, and started learning `Python` (*no comment*). <br>

I got it to a pretty decent level over the years and worked on some [cool projects](projects). <br>

After taking a big break of almost 2 years, I am back in the game, started learning `C`, and some `Red Teaming *stuff*` and working on my biggest project, \*yet\* , [**VIAL**](projects/vial).
